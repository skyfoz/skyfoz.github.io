          There is this platformer game called <button class="btnTxt" onclick="location.href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_(video_game)'">Celeste</button>, which is one of my favorite games of all time.
          On this game there's a pretty active modding community, so I wanted to create <button class="btnTxt" onclick="location.href = 'https://gamebanana.com/mods/612517'">my own mod</button>. Modding this game uses C# and lua mainly and it's pretty straightforward because there are a lot of people willing to help.
          In this mod, I created a new mechanic about teleportation, you can learn more on the mod's page.

          I also made something, that gets some environment data around player, it was a bit hard because at that time i knew nothing in c# and I also had to work with python, sending data through a local server and things. Originally it was for a bigger project, but it was in fact too big for me and my lil knowledge.
          You can find what it does just in <button class="btnTxt" onclick="location.href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLsmwdXQsHQ'">this video</button>, I know it's not super clear but I know how it works, I think that's what matters.

          With friends, we wanted to do a 100% achievements on minecraft but it was somehow hard to link all of our achievements together, it's not anything complicated but it was really useful ! 
          You can find it <button class="btnTxt" onclick="location.href = 'https://github.com/skyfoz/Minecraft-linked-achievements'">here</button> !

          I think you know what I'm talking about, I learned Html, CSS and JS for this, even though I had some knowledge before.
